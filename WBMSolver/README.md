# Wave-based method (WBM) solver 
Original code written by Junghwan Kook, modified by Nikolas Borrel-Jensen (2023).

* `WBM2D_main.m`: The main code for solving the Helmholtz equation in 2D.
* `WBM2D_coupled_main.m`: Code for coupling two WBM domains (see also hybrid_helmholtz2D_main.m)
* `convergence_study_2D.m`: The convergence studies can be found inside  for reproducing results from 'Accelerated methods for computing acoustic sound fields in dynamic virtual environments with moving sources' (N. Borrel-Jensen, PhD Thesis, Technical University of Denmark 2023).
* `Greens2D_main.m`: Additional code for calculting the Green's function to the Helmholtz equation.
